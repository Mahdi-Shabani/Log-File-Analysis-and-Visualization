## Log File Analysis and Visualization

This project provides a comprehensive solution for extracting valuable insights from Nginx log files. By leveraging Python,
 the project efficiently parses and cleans log data, stores it in a MySQL database, and generates informative visualizations.

 ## Key Features:

Data Extraction: Extracts crucial fields such as IP address, timestamp, request method, URL, status code, response size, and query parameters from Nginx log files.
Data Cleaning: Implements robust data cleaning techniques to ensure data quality and accuracy.
Database Storage: Stores structured and cleaned data in a MySQL database for efficient querying and analysis.
Visualization: Generates insightful visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs) to uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies within the log data.

## Technologies Used:

Python
Nginx log parsing libraries (e.g., nginxlog)
MySQL
Data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
